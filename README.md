1.) Problem Statement: Predicting Password Strength using Pattern Matching

Principles of Programming Language Angle:

In the realm of Principles of Programming Language (POPL), the problem of predicting password strength serves as a practical and relevant application of programming language concepts. The central goal is to leverage the paradigms and features introduced in programming languages like Haskell and C++ to create a robust and efficient solution for assessing the strength of passwords.
